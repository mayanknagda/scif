<i>1) Prior request from the faculty user with necessary details about the sample is required.</i><br>
<i>2) Only two samples are allowed per request for the slot.</i><br>
<i>3) Before giving the sample for TEM analysis, it is suggested that each sample is characterized by any other techniques such as XRD, SEM, AFM etc.</i><br>
<i>4) Magnetic samples or samples which are not high vacuum compatible cannot be analyzed by TEM.</i><br>
<i>5) The requisition form can be filled online and duly signed print out of the filled form should be submitted at the TEM facility.</i><br>
<i>6) Justified requests will be considered for available slots and the user will be informed through e-mail.</i><br>
<i>7) We recommend that the sample preparation including the copper grids is arranged by the users and the prepared samples should be submitted in advance to the slot time at the TEM facility. Samples should reach well TEM Lab at least one day prior to your fixed slot.</i><br>
<i>8) About 45 minutes will be spent per sample. Maximum two researchers, at least one being faculty/research scholar will be allowed to join the technician inside the TEM room during the sample observation.</i><br>
